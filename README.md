# Investigate-a-Dataset
I am using the Baseball dataset (2016 version) for this project.
I will mention along the way which datasets specifically I am using.

**Questions I will investigate:**
1) What is the relationship between the doubles and the triples of the players? 
2) What is the relationship between the winning and losing pitches of the players? 
3) What are the traits of the players with above average salaries?

**Python**
-histograms
-scatterplots
-correlations
-dataframes
